Yoga Class Analysis using Human pose estimation

Yoga Class Analysis using Human Pose Estimation
This is a lab project for the Deep Learning course of the Data Science program. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can automatically classify images of people doing yoga poses into different categories using human pose estimation.

Business Understanding
The yoga pose image classification problem involves automatically classifying images of people doing yoga poses into different categories. This is an image recognition problem that belongs to the field of machine learning.

Data Requirements & Data Collection
The dataset used for this project is attached. You can download it from the given link and extract the contents to the dataset/ folder.

Environment Setup
To run the code, you need to set up a virtual environment and install the required packages. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
Create a virtual environment by running the following command:
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment by running:
bash
Copy code
source venv/Scripts/activate
Install the required packages by running:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Understanding & Data Preparation
The data_processing.ipynb notebook contains code for data understanding and preparation. Run the notebook in Jupyter to preprocess the dataset.

Data Modeling & Model Evaluation
The yoga_classification.ipynb notebook contains code for building and evaluating the model. Run the notebook in Jupyter to train and test the model.
