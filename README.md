# Yoga Class Analysis using Human pose estimation

This is a lab project for the Deep Learning course of the Data Science program. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can automatically classify images of people doing yoga poses into different categories using human pose estimation.

## Business Understanding
The yoga pose image classification problem involves automatically classifying images of people doing yoga poses into different categories. This is an image recognition problem that belongs to the field of deep learning specifically computer vision.

## 2- Environment Setup
To run the code, you need to set up a virtual environment and install the required packages. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
``` git clone ```
### Create a virtual environment by running the following command:
 - Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project after cloning it and run: 

```  python -m venv venv ``` 
 - Activate the virtual environment by running:
 
``` source venv/Scripts/activate ``` 

Install the required packages by running:
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
